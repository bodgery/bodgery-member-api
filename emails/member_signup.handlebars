Hello fellow Bodger!

First of all, welcome! If you’re receiving this you’ve gone through the 
orientation and are a full-fledged member. It also means we’ve added you to our 
two email groups (The Bodgery for members only, and MadCity Makers for the 
wider community).  An invite to Slack is on the way - please sign up to join 
the conversation!

An introductory email to the membership is going out, sharing the info you 
filled out on your maker interests, so our community can meet you!  It’s 
a large community and a large shop, so we try to keep folks connected.

If you have questions about how things work, or your own projects, post them in 
Slack or the members-only email group. If you want to get signed off on tools, 
email the area captains (listed here) of that area, or post a message on that 
channel in Slack.

We’ll see you around the shop!
